This project aims to develop a book recommendation system using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing rich demographic information from 278,858 anonymized users 
and their explicit or implicit ratings of 1,149,780 books available on the Book Crossing website. With a vast repository of user interactions and book metadata, 
this dataset offers a fertile ground for exploring various recommendation algorithms and techniques. As the dataset was over 400mb, I wasn't able to upload it. 

Objectives
Employ data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
Explore algorithms such as user-based filtering and content-based filtering to model user preferences and predict book recommendations accurately.
Enhance user engagement and satisfaction by delivering relevant and compelling book recommendations tailored to individual interests and preferences.


Project Highlights
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure data integrity and reliability, addressing missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
Utilized sentiment analysis to gain insights into user preferences and emotions towards book content.
Implemented user-based filtering and content-based filtering approaches, both achieving commendable precision scores of 1.0.
Improved the recall metric by increasing the number of recommended books, highlighting the importance of considering the entire dataset.
Refined features used in content-based filtering to enhance recommendation scores for certain books.
Adopted a hybridization strategy combining user-based and content-based filtering to ensure robust recommendations that encompass diverse user preferences and content attributes.
Dynamically selected the most suitable filtering method based on user interaction thresholds, recognizing the strengths of user-based filtering with ample user engagement.
Emphasized the iterative nature of recommendation system development, with continual refinement and adaptation essential to meet evolving user needs and preferences.
